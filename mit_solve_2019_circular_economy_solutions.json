Our technology treats wastewater by upcycling waste organics into commercially valuable bioproducts. Our main product, polyhydroxyalkanoates, are microbial polyesters with applications similar to conventional plastics; however, if our bioplastics are not recycled, they will biodegrade in the natural environment.",
